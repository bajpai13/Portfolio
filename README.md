# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site serves as a showcase of my work, skills, and experiences. I have used minimal JS and kept it more towards the frontend side.


## Overview

This website contains a very simple interface. 

### The files are - 

- index.html - It contains all the HTML and some JavaScript of the project.

- style.css - It contains the styling part of the project.

- imagesnew - This folder contains all the images required for this project.
